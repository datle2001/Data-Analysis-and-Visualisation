A Python project designed to analyze and visualize DC's and Marvel's character data
1.Print the number of characters that are women. Give both the total number of women and the percentage of all characters that are women. 
2.Print the number of appearances that are by women characters. Give both the total number of appearances by women and the percentage of total appearances that are by women. 
3.Print the number of characters that are a gender or sexual minority (GSM). Give both the total number and percentage of all characters. For this, assume that any entry in the column is a GSM character. 
4.Print the oldest character (by year). If there are multiple characters tied for oldest, print them all. You only need to use the year for this calculation.
5.Print the character with the most appearances. 
6.Print the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the number of appearances of all characters. 
7.Graph the number of characters who first appeared by year. 
8.Graph the number of Good, Bad, and Neutral characters, either as a bar graph or a pie graph.
